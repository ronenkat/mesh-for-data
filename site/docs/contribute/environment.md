# Development Environment

This page describes what you need to install as a developer and contributor to this project, for setting up a development environment.

## Operating system

Linux and Mac OS operating systems are officially supported.

Windows users should consider using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2), 
a remote Linux machine, or any other solution such as a virtual machine.

## Dependencies

Install the following on your machine:

1. [go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.16 or above
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
1. `make`
1. `jq`
1. `unzip`
1. Maven (`mvn`) 
1. Java Development Kit version 8 or above
1. **Mac only**: `brew install coreutils` (installs the timeout command)


Then, run the following command to install additional dependencies:

```bash
make install-tools
```

This installs additional dependencies to `hack/tools/bin`. The `make` targets (e.g., `make test`) are configured to use the binaries from `hack/tools/bin`. However, you may want to add some of these tools to your system PATH for direct usage from your terminal (e.g., for using `kubectl`).

## Editors

The project is predominantly written in Go so we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Go) for its good Go support. Alternatively you can select from [Editors](https://golang.org/doc/editors.html)

## Docker hub rate limits
As docker hub introduced rate limits on docker image downloads this may effect development using the local kind setup.
One option to fix the limit is to use a docker hub login for downloading the images. The environment will run
a docker registry as a proxy for all public images. This registry runs in a docker container next to the kind clusters. 

```shell
export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME='your docker hub username'
export DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD='your password'
```
